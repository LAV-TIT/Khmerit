			<h3>About this module</h3>
      <p>Origin of this module comes from <strong>ListIt Module</strong> developed by <strong>Ben Malen</strong>.<br />As there were no plans on further development of the module some people decided to fork the module and continue with development.<br />
			This is a third generation fork of the module and there are others. Consider this as another flavour of the original module.<br />
			If you find any bugs please feel free to submit a bug report <a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/bug/list/1345" target="_blank">here</a> or for any good ideas consider submiting a feature request <a href="http://dev.cmsmadesimple.org/feature_request/list/1345" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Please keep in mind that developers do have their daily jobs which means that feature requests are considered and done as time allows. If you need a feature really badly consider contacting one of the developers for a sponsored development.
