	<h3>Usage</h3>
    
    <p>You can configure {$module_name} here: Content &raquo; {$module_name}</p>
    <p>Place this tag in your page: {ldelim}{$module_name}}</p>
    <br />

	<p>After installing the module the next thing to do is set the options.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>To change the name of the module in the menu change the "Module Friendly Name".</li>
        <li>To change the name of the item tab change the "Item Plural".</li>
    </ol>

	<p>Next - set the Field Definitions.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Choose from "Text Input", "Checkbox", "Text Area", "Select Date", "Select File", "Content Pages"  &amp; "Dropdown".</li>
        <li>For each field definition, you can specify or choose additional settings<br /> from available options which depend on field definition type.</li>
        <li>Each item in each list has three default fields. <br />All Field Definitions set here are additional to them.</li>
    </ol>

	<p>To be able to use Categories with your LISE instance you will have to create a Field definition with type of "Category".<br />
        Once a Field definition was create new Tab with name "Categories" will become available in your LISE module instance.<br />
	Now you can start adding categories.</p>

	<p>Now we move on to the item list itself. In this example it says "Add Box", this was renamed in the "Options" tab.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>The first field is the default "Title" field.</li>
        <li>The "Category" dropdown is also a default field, and if unchanged, will be set to "General".</li>
        <li>The third default field is the checkbox called "Active". This allows you to toggle a list entry without deleting it.</li>
    </ol>
